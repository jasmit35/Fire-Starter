These are the steps used to build the initial “Fire-Starter” application.

1. Created the project on GitHub owned by jasmit35.
	a. Named it Fire-Starter, included a ReadMe, no .gitignore and used the GNUGPL v3.0.

2. Cloned the repository down to Woz.
	a. Created the directory ~/Development/Fire-Starter on woz.
	b. Used the script ~/local/bin/git_clone to download the start from GitHub.

3. Setup homebrew, pip and pipenv.
	a. su - admin
	b. /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

	c. brew upgrade : brew update
	d. brew install pipenv
	e. pipenv –version
	f. cd ~/Development/Fire-Starter
	g. pipenv shell

4. Commit and push to GitHub.

5. Add starter files so you end up with
      Pipfile
      setup.py
      Build Fire-Starter.docx
      Build Fire-Starter.txt
      LISCENSE
      README.md
      Fire-Starter/
      	fire-starter.py
      tests/
      	fire-starter-test.pv
      
6. Generate the text file from the Word document.

7. Commit the final version and push it to GitHub.
